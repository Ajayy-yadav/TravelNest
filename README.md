Project Description: TravelNest
Overview:
TravelNest is a web application that provides a platform for users to list, discover, and book accommodations across the globe, similar to Airbnb. The application is designed to connect travelers with hosts offering unique places to stay, ranging from cozy apartments to luxurious villas. Built with a robust tech stack, TravelNest combines modern web technologies to deliver a seamless user experience for both travelers and hosts.

Frontend:

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): TravelNest uses EJS to dynamically generate HTML pages based on the data retrieved from the server. This allows for a flexible and reusable component-based architecture, where common elements like headers, footers, and navigation bars are included across different pages.

Bootstrap: The frontend is styled using Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user interface. Bootstrap's grid system and pre-built components like modals, carousels, and forms are used to create a modern, user-friendly design.

HTML/CSS: Custom HTML and CSS are used alongside Bootstrap to fine-tune the visual elements, ensuring that the design aligns with TravelNest's branding and provides an intuitive user experience.

Backend:

Express.js: The backend of TravelNest is powered by Express.js, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. Express.js handles routing, middleware, and API integration, serving as the backbone of the application. It manages user authentication, session management, and interaction with the database.

MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the primary database for TravelNest, storing user information, property listings, bookings, and reviews. The database is designed to handle complex queries efficiently, allowing for features like filtering search results based on location, price range, amenities, and user ratings.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to the platform using email and password. Sessions are managed securely with Express.js middleware.

Property Listings: Hosts can list their properties, providing details like title, description, location, price, availability, and images. Each property is displayed attractively on the platform, with EJS dynamically rendering the content.

Search and Filter: Travelers can search for accommodations based on various criteria such as location, check-in/check-out dates, number of guests, and price range. The results can be further filtered to match specific needs, like properties with Wi-Fi, parking, or pet-friendly options.

Booking System: Once travelers find a suitable property, they can book it directly through the platform. The booking process is straightforward, with confirmation sent to both the traveler and the host.

Reviews and Ratings: After a stay, travelers can leave reviews and rate their experience, helping future users make informed decisions.

Responsive Design: TravelNest is fully responsive, ensuring that users have an optimal experience whether they're accessing the platform on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
